        Launch vehicle

        A launch vehicle or carrier rocket is a rocket-propelled vehicle used to carry a 
        payload from Earth's surface to space, usually to Earth orbit or beyond. Our 
        WEB-X carrier rocket is the most powerful in operation. Standing 150 metres tall, 
        it's quite an awe-inspiring sight on the launch pad!
